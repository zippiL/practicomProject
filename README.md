## about me
This application was built using React and .net
The application is designed to provide quick solutions for businesses in managing a pool of employees and their roles. The system is presented in a user-friendly and convenient way.
The system allows:
1. Displaying employees - the system allows you to see the list of positions for each employee, edit their details, add a position and delete it.
2. Displaying the existing roles in the system - possibility to add a new role to the system and edit an existing role.
3. Export all employees to an excel file and print them.
4. Option to search for employees according to different parameters and filter them.
Of course, the system has security measures where only a manager can see the details of his employees.
