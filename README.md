## about me
This application was built using React and .net
The application is designed to provide quick solutions for businesses in managing a pool of employees and their roles. The system is presented in a user-friendly and convenient way.
The system allows:
1. Displaying employees - the system allows you to see the list of positions for each employee, edit their details, add a position and delete it.
2. Displaying the existing roles in the system - possibility to add a new role to the system and edit an existing role.
3. Export all employees to an excel file and print them.
4. Option to search for employees according to different parameters and filter them.
Of course, the system has security measures where only a manager can see the details of his employees.

Now you can see that the user is logged in and that the Employee role is enabled

Now we can turn to the employee table

For each employee in the table you can see their roles

and it is possible to edit its details. By clicking the edit button, a form opens for me.
This form is also used to add an employee.

To delete we click on the appropriate button, a message will appear and when we confirm it the column will be deleted.

Since I want this application to be dynamic, I added a table of roles where the administrator can add roles and edit them.
Only a role that does not have employees who exercise it can be deleted.
